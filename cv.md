### Profile

As software and technology [disrupt traditional enterprise](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460) and create entirely new types of businesses, I'm excited about roles that require deep technical capability combined with a need for strong stakeholder and team influence. Growing to understand the potent nexus of soft and hard skills, I enjoy roles with opportunity to pursue both.

### Experience

#### Haak Systems
##### *2011 to Current* (own company for side projects)
Built an [**NFC** enabled app](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150710005103/en/Thinfilm-World-Introduce-%E2%80%9CSmart-Wine-Bottle%E2%80%9D-Featuring#.VfAzgJ2qqkp) leveraging Internet of Things (**IoT**) tech to identify and fight counterfeit wine for Australian vineyards selling into the Chinese market. Project now extended to validating other Australian made items internationally. Built a mine tenement management system in the **Cloud** using **Microsoft Azure** PaaS to lower ongoing support costs. Worked on a [complex robot system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK6LWGfC72o) designed to automate analysis or iron ore samples, and another robot that used **Computer Vision** to QA and stack freshly minted gold coins. Built a **drone** for a [Outback UAV Challenge](http://uavchallenge.org/), and planning to re-enter. Working on an **IoT** project for divers to monitor water quality and visibility at various recreational dive sites.

#### Ajilon Australia
#####*2010 to Current* (full-time contractor)
Clients include Landgate, BHP Billiton Iron Ore, Woodside and WA Police.  
As a **Solutions Architect** at WA Police designed a *"Licensing and Registry"* system. Responsible for detailed solution design and compliance with business, legal and enterprise requirements. $9M+ budget involving integration with multiple external third parties and several internal Police systems. Involves a mix of technical panache, communicating complicated problems coherently to CxO and board level whilst ensuring the 20+ team on the ground keeps moving in the right direction.

Developed a **methodology** for rapid delivery of small projects. Heavily influenced by **Agile**, **Scrum** and **UX** movements it was designed to fail projects early & fast or deliver. Landed a number of projects within very tight timeframes as an **Agile Lead**. Internal customers were so pleased with their results that the process was promoted through the organisation. Incredibly rewarding to deliver meaningful business-oriented systems from nothing to production, sometimes in less than six weeks with barebones budget and a small team.

Took over as **Team Lead** of the BHP Billiton Iron Ore Integration team. Wrote bespoke tools to support **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment** **(CI/CD)** of an ancient SAP integration system, and oversaw the migration to a new IBM middleware layer. In true **DevOps** style, we were responsible for building and supporting the first interfaces on the new system. Then moved on to work on a logistics and supply chain system for BHP's 1SAP project. Also built some proof of concepts that ended up being both simple and reliable enough to just go to production without needing a real project.

Rebuilt Landgate's core business application in the **Cloud** very, very quickly as a proof of concept. The POC gave confidence to the organisation that Cloud technology was fit for purpose. Landgate is now in the process of moving their land registry to **AWS**. It also showed something tangible to decision makers and investors looking to spin off a new listed company focused on land title management.

As Ajilon's National **Competency lead for Integration and Application Development** worked to cultivate community and capability across our technical staff. Organised regular catch ups for special interest groups, as well as organising a *hackathon*-style **Code Jam** that brought a diverse set of client business problems to our own development teams. Ended up as a win-win because it built community amongst our developers who can be quite siloed at client sites, and created material that demonstrated new thinking and innovation to our clients.

#### CCK Financial Solutions
##### (2009-2010)
Working as a **Developer** learnt the beauty of **Smalltalk** and Object Oriented (non relational) databases. Built treasury management software for several major international banks.

#### Thales Group
##### (2008-2009)
Wrote **C, C++ and Java** as a **Software Engineer** on a Distributed Combat system for the Australian Navy that integrated command and control for [missiles](http://www.defence.gov.au/media/download/2007/sep/20070911a/index.htm), guns, radars, tactical data networks and many other military gadgets. Ran on **Solaris**.

#### Market Sentinel
##### (2007-2008)
London startup using **Big Data** tech (**Hadoop**) running on **AWS** to leverage **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** algorithms to perform **sentiment analysis** on **social media**. Built in the form of a vertical search engine, sold analysis to companies trying to manage their reputation online (big pharma, retail etc.) If this means nothing to you, it was cool, cutting edge and before its time.

#### Data Analysis Australia
##### (2004-2007)
Working as a **Systems Programmer** wrote stats analysis packages in **R** and **Python**, Looked after some **PostgreSQL** databases and a room of servers. First taste of the open source community and **Linux**.

### Other interests
* Tinkering with embedded electronics like **Arduino** and **Raspberry Pi**.
* Novelty endurance sporting challenges - have completed Avon Descent, Marathons, Ultra Marathons and a (half) Iron Man.
* Have travelled extensively on many unusual but excellent international holidays.
* Involved in the Perth tech scene, regular competitor of **Hackathons** and a member at **Spacecubed**  
* Drones and other autonomous technology such as driverless cars.
